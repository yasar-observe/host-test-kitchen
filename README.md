# Infrastructure as Code Testing

This project uses Test Kitchen with Docker to validate our infrastructure. It includes a Makefile for easy command handling and a Dockerfile to create a standardized testing environment.

## Environment Variables

These environment variables are used for running the tests:

- `OBSERVE_CUSTOMER`: The Observe customer
- `OBSERVE_TOKEN`: The Observe token
- `OBSERVE_DOMAIN`: The Observe environment domain (default: observe-eng.com)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: Your AWS session token (if required)
- `AWS_REGION`: Your preferred AWS region (default: us-east-1)
- `PROVIDER`: `terraform` or `cloudformation` (default: cloudformation)

If you want to persist your environment configuration a `env.template` file is available

```
cp env.template .env
vi .env # edit the values
source .env
```

We're ignoring `.env*` so feel free make as many as required ie `.env-cloudformation` or `.env-accountnumber` etc

## Docker

### Prerequisites

1. AWS Access ( `aws sts get-caller-identity` is your friend )
2. A valid observe customer / token / domain
3. Docker installed

### Testing

1. Run the tests within a docker container by running `make docker/test`.
2. To clean up the resources created during the test, run `make docker/test/clean`
3. To clean up the resources including the docker image / container run `make docker/clean`

## Manual

### Prerequisites

1. AWS Access ( `aws sts get-caller-identity` is your friend )
2. A valid observe customer / token / domain
3. Ensure the dependencies within the `./validate_deps.sh` script are installed by running `./validate_deps.sh`.
4. Install the gems listed within the Gemfile via `bundler install`.

### Testing

1. Run `make test` to validate dependencies, create the kitchen environment and run the verifier.
2. To clean up the resources created during the test, run `make test/clean`.

## Test Kitchen 101
Refer to the test kitchen (documentation)[https://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/introduction/] but bellow is a brief explanation of some common commands.

Provision the infrastructure
```
# make test/create
kitchen create
```

Test the infrastructure agains the spec
```
# make test/verify
kitchen verify

# the rspec equivalent
rspec -c -f documentation --default-path '/workdir'  -P 'test/integration/base/verify/collection_spec.rb'
```

Teardown the infrastructure
```
# make test/clean
kitchen destroy
```

## GitHub Actions - Manual Workflow Trigger

In addition to the automated tests that run on pull requests and pushes to the `main` branch, you can also manually trigger the testing workflow using GitHub's `workflow_dispatch` event.

### How to Manually Trigger the Workflow:

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Select the desired workflow from the left sidebar.
3. Click on the "Run workflow" button on the right side.
4. Select the branch on which you want to run the workflow.
5. Provide the required inputs:
   - `test_type`: Choose between 'terraform' or 'cloudformation'.
   - `code_sha`: Provide the SHA of the terraform or cloudformation code to checkout.
6. Click the "Run workflow" button.

This allows for more flexibility in testing, especially in scenarios where you might want to test specific changes or configurations without making a pull request or a push.

For more details on GitHub's workflow dispatch event, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow).
